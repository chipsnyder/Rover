# Rover
A Sample app to serve up images from https://api.nasa.gov/api.html#MarsPhotos

This is a sample application I did specifically to showcase my skills and experiment with some different tools and design patterns. Itâ€™s a simple app that provides Images from Mars rovers Curiosity, Opportunity, and Spirt. You can find the API here: https://api.nasa.gov/api.html#MarsPhotos (No guarantee on the API maintenance). The app will allow you to pick one of the rovers, pick a camera, then browse photos over time. I created this code sample as a technical knowledge of Swift, networking, unit testing, functional testing, and clean code practices.

## Architecture
This app is built on VIPER (https://www.objc.io/issues/13-architecture/viper/)
